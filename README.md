## Programming Assignment

### Multinomial NB Classifier:
Text collection:
* The 1095 news documents.
* 13 classes (id 1~13), each class has 15 training documents.
* The remaining documents are for testing.

Note:
* For each class, you have to calculate M P(X=t|c) parameters. M is the size of your vocabulary.
* Then, the total number of parameters in your system will be |C|*M ðŸ¡¨ can be a huge number.
* We know that many terms in the vocabulary are not indicative.
* Employ at least one feature selection method and use only 500 terms in your classification.
  * Î§2 test.
  * Likelihood ratio.
  * Pointwise/expected MI.
  * Frequency-based methods.
* When classify a testing document, terms not in the selected vocabulary are ignored.
* To avoid zero probabilities, calculate P(X=t|c) by using add-one smoothing:

$P(X = t_k \mid c) = \frac{T_{ct_k} + 1}{\sum_{t' \in V} (T_{ct'} + 1)} = \frac{T_{ct_k} + 1}{\sum_{t' \in V} T_{ct'} + |V|}$
